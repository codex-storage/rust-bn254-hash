`rust-poseidon2-bn254`
--------------------

Rust implementation of the Poseidon2 hash function over the BN254 curve's scalar field,
with permutation state width `t=3`. 

Currently using [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) for field arithmetic
(maybe replace it with something more light-weight in the future...)
